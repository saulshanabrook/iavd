    * about this site
        * This website has been created to provide information about the project “Integrated Audio-Visual Documentation of Itelmen.” This is a collaborative endeavor between the University of Connecticut (Jonathan Bobaljik, PI) and the University of Alaska Fairbanks (David Koester, PI), with the further collaboration of Chiba University in Japan(Chikako Ono, PI). It inolves directly also Tatiana Degai (Ph.D. candidate, University of Arizona) and technical consultants and developers, Alexandre Arkhipov, Tom Myers, and Alexander Nakhimovsky. With funding from the National Science Foundation, the aim of the project is to integrate accumulated recordings of the Itelmen language with transcriptions into a digital corpus with additional linkages to Itelmen language.
    * about itelmen
        * Originally Itelmen was spoken throughout Kamchatka, and possibly also in the northern Kuril Islands. Vladimir Atalsov, who annexed Kamchatka and established military bases in the region, estimated in 1697 that there were about 20,000 ethnic Itelmens. The 18th century explorer Stepan Krasheninnikov, who gave the first detailed description of the Itelmen language and culture, identified the three main dialects, but explained that all Itelmens could understand each other.

    * David Koester
        * David Koester is a socio-cultural anthropologist specializing in the peoples of the North and especially peoples and cultures of the North Pacific and North Atlantic. He has been working with Itelmen people in Kamchatka since 1992. His main focus over the years has been Itelmen cultural revitalization, Itelmen music, the legacy of Soviet social policies and life histories of individuals, including the extensive life history of Tatiana Petrovna Lukashkina. He is interested in the study of songs and poetic forms in the Itelmen language and in helping with efforts to preserve the language through both traditional means and current technology.
